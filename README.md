The jupyter notebook mainly serves to highlight my thought processes when it came to feature engineering and exploratory data analysis. Due to time constraints, I was not able to attempt a grid search of the hyperparamters of the various models I tried, or test other models.

For the purpose of testing, the model and preprocessing scripts are saved as python scripts, accesssible by running main.py and modifying the variable `DATA_PATH` to point towards a CSV file.
